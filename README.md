# Lambert-Air-Management-System
Keene State College - Software Engineering Project 2022. Matthew Lavin, Joshua Snider, Andrew Daur. 

This project was made in the Software Engineering Project course at Keene State College, taught by Professor Elvis Foster. 
The objective of the course was to create a robust Flight Management System that could be used by airlines and customers to make their flying experience faster and easier. 

Flight Traffic has more than doubled within the last two decades. Airport management is a highly dynamic job with strict requirements for efficiency. There are a limited number of runways, gates and terminals which all need to serve the flight volume. Lambert Air Management aims to ease the tension cause by the magnitude of travel. 

The Solution? 
LAMS. A flight management system developed entirely from scratch. 
This provides the user with easy data entry and decision-making for staff, and modern data output for customers. 
Proven software means deployment at any airport. 
Built entirley in standard object-oriented languages with MySQL and MariaDB being used for data storage.
